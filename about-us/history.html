                                        The great visionary, a farsighted genius, a philanthropist, and a social reformer, Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia was born into a noble family of Punjab. After pursuing higher education in England, he returned with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a commitment to liberal learning. His will, opened on September 12, 1898, laid the foundation for a “First Class Arts College” in Lahore to provide “Sound Liberal Education” and promote “Pure Morality.”

                                    <p>
                                        This vision became a reality when Dyal Singh College was established in Lahore on May 3, 1910. Following the partition, the college was reconstituted in Karnal in 1949 under the enlightening guidance of Dewan Anand Kumar. A man of diverse talents, Sardar Dyal Singh also founded enduring institutions like the Punjab National Bank and The Tribune newspaper. Today, Dyal Singh College, Karnal, strives to carry on the mighty legacy of its founder, instilling intellectual fervour and liberal thinking in every generation of students.

                                       Dewan Anand Kumar, born on February 6, 1894, was the guiding force behind the college's re-establishment. Educated at Cambridge University, he chose to become an educational administrator, dedicating his life to building institutions of excellence. Despite losing nearly everything during the Partition, he began from scratch in India with remarkable strength of character.

                                        His tireless efforts led to the successful re-establishment of not only Dyal Singh College in Karnal but also Dyal Singh College in New Delhi, the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal, and Thapar Engineering College in Patiala, among others. He served as the Vice-Chancellor of Panjab University from 1949 to 1957 and was a member of the University Grants Commission (UGC) from 1958 to 1964. His passion for creating a legacy of excellence that stands the test of time is reflected in the motto and ideology that Dyal Singh College, Karnal, lives by today.
